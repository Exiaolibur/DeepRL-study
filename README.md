# DeepRL-study
study projects in RL, DeepRL, OpenAI Gymnasium, stable baseline3

Project-1: 

PPO for CartPole. Based on stable baseline3(for the algorithm) and Gymnasium(for the environment).

referring to the blog: https://medium.com/revelry-labs/understanding-and-using-reinforcement-learning-fa226ea2107f

I wrote this code after reading it. And tuned the hyperparameters(episodes and total time_step for model training), and now this cart can hold this pole for a long time.
