# DeepRL-study
study projects in RL, DeepRL, OpenAI Gymnasium, stable baseline3

**Project-1:**

PPO for CartPole. Based on stable baseline3(for the algorithm) and Gymnasium(for the environment).

referring to the blog: https://medium.com/revelry-labs/understanding-and-using-reinforcement-learning-fa226ea2107f

I wrote this code after reading it. And tuned the hyperparameters(episodes and total time_step for model training), and now this cart can hold this pole for a long time.

**Peoject-2:**

This is for learning Deep Q-learning

referring to the project guide : https://towardsdatascience.com/develop-your-first-ai-agent-deep-q-learning-375876ee2472#c87e

I'm still working on it. but you can see the files of the projects I have done in the Project-2 folder.
