**steps:**
1. Environment.py is a prototype-porject which is mainly about the Environment part in RL loop.
   It has essential parts like rendering and reset methods in a 2-dimension RL assignment.
   The output of reset() method is reshaped into a 1-dimension list(long array) as input of Neural Network.
